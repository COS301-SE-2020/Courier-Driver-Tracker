#### Carel Kemp von Molendorff
I am currently a Third Year BIT Student. I have an interest in creating functional software and
Artificial Intelligence. Where my skills are concerned, I am confident in my ability to make a functional and effective back-end for systems. My skills with front-end are lacking in the aesthetic side, what I make works, but it does not really please the eye. I plan to keep front-ends I work on simple, minimalist and effective to counter this. If it only needs three buttons, just add three buttons.

#### Gian Geyser
I am a 3rd year BIT student who loves to be challenged. I have no preference when it comes to front
end or back end development, but rather focus on the improvement of whatever I'm working on. If it could be
more efficient, I would put in the extra time to achieve it. I also like ascetically pleasing UI's and spend a lot of effort and time on it, but my experience so far is limited.
