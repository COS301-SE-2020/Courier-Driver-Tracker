# Courier-Driver-Tracker
## Description
Courier-Driver-Tracker is a system that provides an efficient way to track a fleet of courier vehicles. Beyond tracking, it should detect abnormal behaviours and alert the relevant people if those patterns repeat often. The App also supplies data that will be used to generate reports that will be sent weekly.
